                    million requests and turning it into
                    a vision. I had to move my entire
                    wedding from KC to Raleigh at
                    the last minute (7 months before
                    the wedding) and Theresa was by
                    far the easiest vendor I worked
                    with when I moved everything to
                    Raleigh! Major bonus points for
                    punctuality, thoroughness, and
                    being so respectful of my house

                She is a true artist and gives 100% every time. 
                She is organized beyond belief, extremely professional, and constantly makes sure you feel comfortable and beautiful. 
                And wow <span class="font-weight-bold">I don’t think I’ve ever looked as good as I did on my wedding</span> and that’s a huge nod to Theresa.
