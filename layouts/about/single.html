                        has always enjoyed
                        expressing herself through many forms of art. She
                        spent many hours immersed in her sidewalk chalk
                        art as a young person.

                        The passion of makeup artistry first ignited when
                        she was pursuing her art degree at the University
                        of North Carolina in Asheville. Portraits were
                        her senior focus, utilizing chalk as the medium of
                        choice once again. She always enjoyed applying
                        the makeup to the portrait drawings. As her senior
                        thesis was coming to a close, she started to dabble
                        in costume makeup.

                        After school, she started working and training in
                        makeup at Sephora. She loved learning all about
                        skin care, makeup, and working with a wide variety
                        of clientele. After about a year at Sephora, Theresa
                        knew she had found her calling and so she attained
                        an Esthetics License with the state of North Carolina.
