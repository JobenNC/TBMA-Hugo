                        Most of us, like myself, know a lot of other wedding professionals and can give recommendations.

                    <p class="answer">
                        If we are coming to you, extra time needs to be allotted for setting up and breaking down.
                        It takes about 20-30 minutes to set everything up and 15-30 to break everything down. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="answer">
                        It's important that someone is present while we pack up gear until we make our final exit. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="answer">
                        The makeup appointment itself takes between 40-90 minutes.
                        As a general rule of thumb we like to allow an hour per person and then add an hour for buffer time.
                        We know that on event days there are interruptions and things that happen that cause delays so we want to ensure there is plenty of time for pampering!

                    </h3>
                    <p class="answer">
                        For weddings, We always allow 1 hour per person plus 1 hour for buffer at least.
                        So if you have 4 people, we will allow 5 hours of get ready time.
                        Twenty to thirty minutes is also added to the beginning and end of that get ready time for setting up and breaking down our equipment and kits.

                    <p class="answer">
                        Beauty services should conclude at least 1-2 hours before your event.
                        This will give you plenty of time to use the restroom, get into your attire, and take pictures before your ceremony (if it's before a wedding).

                        While every artist, including myself has their own style, we still customize the client's makeup to their individual needs and preferences.
                        We also do our best to put you with an artist that suits your style and through our phone consultations or email conversations we make sure that we would be a good fit.

                        We use many different brands that are geared towards professional use.
                        I enjoy using Viseart, Makeup Atelier, RCMA, Senna Cosmetics, Makeup Forever, and Graftobian to name a few.
                        Each artist will have their own kit that works for their needs and as seasoned artists we are always equipped to work with all ages and global skin tones.

                        If you have sensitive skin, I highly recommend doing a trial because we can do a patch test before your event.

                    </h3>
                    <p class="answer">
                        Before the trial we will discuss your makeup inspiration and what you normally do for special event makeup in great detail.
                        Itâ€™s very important to come with a clean face, no residual eyeliner or mascara, and NO moisturizer on your face.
                        Moisturizer interferes with the prepping process and will need to be removed anyway, this adds on time to the appointment potentially cutting time from the actually application.
                        Removing all residual eyeliner and mascara is especially crucial (especially for weddings) because the old eyeliner and mascara is what will run if you cry (not mine).

                    <p class="answer">
                        A majority of our clients, especially bridal clients are not big makeup wearers.
                        Our philosophy is that the skin should still look like skin even with a full face of makeup.
                        It looks better in person, on camera, and in video. We have a skin prep process that will prepare the face perfectly for makeup.
                        The makeup we use is also designed for high definition cameras, this also adds to the the very skin like element of the makeup.
                        You will still feel like you, but a more defined, polished you.
