                        Why should I hire a professional
                        makeup artist for my event?

                    <p class="answer">
                        There are a few reasons on why it is a good idea to
                        invest in professional makeup artistry and a licensed
                        professional. If this is for a wedding or a special event,
                        you are going to be center stage. Knowing that all eyes
                        will be on you, you want to look your best so you can
                        feel good and enjoy a very momentous day in your life.
                        A trained professional will use professional products and
                        applications to ensure your makeup will last all day and
                        that you look amazing in photographs and video.

                        Estheticians are known as skin therapists. Estheticians

                        facials, waxing, and makeup application.

                        While every artist, including myself has their own
                        style, I still customize all my client's makeup to their
                        individual needs and preferences. I have a few
                        goals: I need for you to still feel like you, and have
                        the makeup accentuate your best features while
                        making you feel confident in how you look and feel

                    <p class="answer">
                        I use many different brands that are geared towards
                        professional use. I enjoy using Viseart, RCMA, Kevyn
                        Aucoin, Senna Cosmetics, Makeup Forever, and
                        Graftobian to name a few. I use high quality brushes
                        from brands such as Makeup Forever and Smith
                        Cosmetics.

                    <p class="answer">
                        I only use hypoallergenic products. If you have sensitive
                        skin, I highly recommend doing a trial because we can do
                        a patch test before your event. If you have products of
                        your own that you would prefer me to use I can definitely
                        accommodate for you.

                    <p class="answer">
                        Yes! I like to call them makeup previews. They are mandatory for brides and highly recommended for non bridal clients. 
                        For the makeup preview, I like to have a consultation  before we start so that I can truly capture your vision (or help you get to one if you don't have one). 
                        I will then begin the luxury skin prep process with a mini facial and proceed with makeup and lashes if desired.

                        Do you do airbrushing?
                    </h3>
                    <p class="answer">
                        I don’t use airbrush tools, but the foundations I use are professional quality and built for HD (You will look amazing in photographs and video)! 
                        Any type of coverage feels lightweight and appears skin-like. All of my clients are also impressed with the long-wearing qualities of the makeup.
