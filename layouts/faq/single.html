                        There are a few reasons on why it is a good idea to
                        invest in professional makeup artistry and a licensed

                        you are going to be center stage. Knowing that all eyes
                        will be on you, you want to look your best so you can

                        If I'm coming to you,
                        extra time needs to be allotted for setting up and breaking down.
                        It takes about 20-35 minutes to set everything up and 20-30 to
                        break everything down.
                        It's important that someone is present while I pack up by gear until I make my final exit. The makeup appointment itself takes between 45-90 minutes. For some occasions I allow 2 hours, but most appointments are 60 minutes.

                    <p class="answer">
                        For weddings, I always allow 1 hour per person plus 1 hour
                        for buffer at least. So if you have 4 people,
                        I will allow 5 hours of get ready time.
                        Twenty to thirty minutes is also added to the

                        Makeup services should conclude at least 2 hours before your event.
                        This will give you plenty of time to use the restroom,
                        get into your attire, and take pictures before your ceremony

                    <p class="answer">
                        Yes! I like to call them makeup previews.
                        For the makeup preview, I like to have a consultation before
                        we start so that I can truly capture your vision
                        (or help you get to one if you don't have one).
                        I will then begin the luxury skin prep process with a mini facial
                        and proceed with makeup and custom lashes.
                        Doing a makeup preview will also allow you to tell me how the
                        makeup lasted and we can make adjustments to ensure the
                        best longevity for your wedding day.
                        For example, if you are afraid you may sweat too much for your liking,
                        I can apply a facial antiperspirant.
                        Everyoneâ€™s skin is different,
                        so special care is taking for each individuals needs.

                    </h3>
                    <p class="answer">
                        Before the trial we will discuss your makeup inspiration
                        and what you normally do for special event makeup in great detail.
                        Itâ€™s very important to come with a clean face,
                        no residual eyeliner or mascara, and NO moisturizer on your face.
                        Moisturizer interferes with the prepping process and will need
                        to be removed anyway, this adds on time to the appointment
                        potentially cutting time from the actually application.
                        Removing all residual eyeliner and mascara is especially crucial
                        (especially for weddings) because the old eyeliner and
                        mascara is what will run if you cry (not mine).

                    <p class="answer">
                        A majority of my clients, especially bridal clients are not big
                        makeup wearers. My philosophy is that the skin should still
                        look like skin even with a full face of makeup.
                        It looks better in person, on camera, and in video.
                        I have a skin prep process that will prepare the face perfectly
                        for makeup. The makeup I use is also designed for high definition
                        cameras, this also adds to the the very skin like element of the
                        makeup. You will still feel like you, but a more defined,
                        polished you.

                    <p class="answer">
                        I know it's tempting to apply moisturizer before your appointment,
                        especially if you have dry skin, but with the process I have for
                        applying makeup I need a blank slate.
                        I start off by doing a chemical exfolint and this must be done
                        on dry, non moisturized skin so that the product can easily grab
                        surface dead skin.  This is step is crucial in the skin prep
                        process because it removes the dead skin cells so the foundation
                        lays on the skin nicely and looks more like skin then makeup.
                        Depending on your skin type I may remove the product with a warm
                        towel or a cool toner.

                    <p class="answer">
                        No and no. You won't need to because I carry several
                        moisturizers that work well under makeup.
                        Not all moisturizers are created equal and some can pill
                        under makeup. It is a great idea to mask the night before

                        Do you do airbrushing?
                    </h3>
                    <p class="answer">
                        I donâ€™t use airbrush tools, but the foundations I use are professional quality and built for HD (You will look amazing in photographs and video)! 
                        Any type of coverage feels lightweight and appears skin-like. All of my clients are also impressed with the long-wearing qualities of the makeup.
